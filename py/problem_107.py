Problem 107: Minimal network

The following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges
with a total weight of 243.

    	A	B	C	D	E	F	G
    A	-	16	12	21	-	-	-
    B	16	-	-	17	20	-	-
    C	12	-	-	28	-	31	-
    D	21	17	28	-	18	19	23
    E	-	20	-	18	-	-	11
    F	-	-	31	19	-	-	27
    G	-	-	-	23	11	27	-

However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and
still ensure that all points on the network remain connected. The network which
achieves the maximum saving has a weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 âˆ’
93 = 150 from the original network.

Using INPUT_FILE, a text file containing a network given in matrix form, find
the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst
ensuring that the network remains connected.
