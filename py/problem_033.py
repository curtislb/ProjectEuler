Problem 33: Digit canceling fractions

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in
attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is
correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in
value, and containing D digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the
value of the denominator.
